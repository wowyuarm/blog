Regarding the emerging new paradigm of human-AI collaboration discussed recently, I prefer to call it "**Nexus** (from Latin nexus, connection, binding)" rather than "super individual," and it can even be compared to "Company."

"Company" belongs to the industrial era, while "Nexus" sounds like a paradigm for the post-human era or the consciousness network era. The former emphasizes business entities, employment relationships, top-down organizations with clear functional division, maintained by management systems; the latter emphasizes connection, fusion, decentralized node networks, and intelligent collaboration, highlighting equal collaboration between humans and AI.

The AI here should not be a general-purpose AI assistant, but a human's "quantified projection," our "digital twin" that can reflect our thoughts, behaviors, etc. General-purpose assistants are too mediocre. AI is not a tool either, but more of a "joint decision-making entity."

Humans and AI should become an intelligent ecosystem, and Nexus emphasizes this connection between them.

I define the operational mode: **Human intelligence-driven + AI computing/execution amplification**

- Humans will serve as the **sole human core and ultimate decision-maker** of the Nexus, responsible for setting strategic vision, core values, and ethical boundaries; responsible for proposing creative ideas, intuitive judgments, and unique human empathy and understanding; responsible for the final review, integration, and value judgment of AI outputs; responsible for critical interactions with the real world (such as occasions requiring human identity). Humans are the helmsman and soul injector.
- AI serves as the **core intelligent engine and execution unit** of the Nexus, responsible for information processing and analysis (N times faster than humans); responsible for generating various solutions, content, and code (providing diverse choices); responsible for executing large amounts of repetitive, procedural tasks (liberating human energy); responsible for simulation, prediction, and optimization (providing data support); responsible for 7x24-hour standby and response. AI is the super brain and infinite arms.

We shouldn't use AI, but become part of the Nexus with AI...
