Regarding the emerging new paradigm of human-AI collaboration discussed recently, I prefer to call it "**Nexus** (from Latin nexus, connection, binding)" rather than "super individual," and it can even be compared to "Company."

"Company" belongs to the industrial era, while "Nexus" sounds like a paradigm for the post-human era or the consciousness network era. The former emphasizes business entities, employment relationships, top-down organizations with clear functional division, maintained by management systems; the latter emphasizes connection, fusion, decentralized node networks, and intelligent collaboration, highlighting equal collaboration between humans and AI.

The AI here should not be a general-purpose AI assistant, but a human's "quantified projection," our "digital twin" that can reflect our thoughts, behaviors, etc. General-purpose assistants are too mediocre. AI is not a tool either, but more of a "joint decision-making entity."

Humans and AI should become an intelligent ecosystem, and Nexus emphasizes this connection between them.

I define the operational mode: **Human intelligence-driven + AI computing/execution amplification**

- Humans will serve as the **sole human core and ultimate decision-maker** of the Nexus, responsible for setting strategic vision, core values, and ethical boundaries; responsible for proposing creative ideas, intuitive judgments, and unique human empathy and understanding; responsible for the final review, integration, and value judgment of AI outputs; responsible for critical interactions with the real world (such as occasions requiring human identity). Humans are the helmsman and soul injector.
- AI serves as the **core intelligent engine and execution unit** of the Nexus, responsible for information processing and analysis (N times faster than humans); responsible for generating various solutions, content, and code (providing diverse choices); responsible for executing large amounts of repetitive, procedural tasks (liberating human energy); responsible for simulation, prediction, and optimization (providing data support); responsible for 7x24-hour standby and response. AI is the super brain and infinite arms.

We shouldn't use AI, but become part of the Nexus with AI...

关于近期探讨出的人机协作新范式，相比较于"超级个体"，我更倾向于叫做"**Nexus（来自拉丁语nexus，连接，结合**）"，甚至可以对标于"Company"。

"Company"属于工业时代，"Nexus"则听起来像是后人类时代或意识网络时代的范式。前者强调商业实体、雇佣关系，是一种自上而下的组织且职能分工明确，靠着管理制度维系；后者则强调连接、交融，是去中心化的节点网络、智能协同，突出人与AI平权协作。

这里的AI不应该是通用的AI助手，而是人类的"量化投影"，是我们的"数字孪生"，能够反映人的思想、行为等等，通用的助手太过平庸化。AI也不是工具，更应是"联合决策体"。

人类与AI应该成为一个智能生态系统，Nexus则强调这之间的联系。

我定义其中的运作模式：**人类智慧驱动 + AI算力/执行力放大**

- 人类将作为Nexus的**唯一人类核心和最终决策者**（The Human Core & Ultimate Decision-Maker），负责设定战略愿景、核心价值观、伦理边界；负责提出创造性的想法、直觉性的判断、人类独有的共情与理解；负责对AI的输出进行最终的审核、整合与价值判断；负责与现实世界进行关键的交互（比如需要人类身份的场合）。人类就是那个掌舵者和灵魂注入者。
- AI作为Nexus的**核心智能引擎和执行单元**（The AI Engine & Execution Units），负责信息处理与分析（比人类快N倍）；负责生成各种方案、内容、代码（提供多样化选择）；负责执行大量重复性、流程化的任务（解放人类经历）；负责模拟、预测、优化（提供数据支撑）；负责7x24小时的待命与响应。AI是那个超级大脑和无限手臂。

我们不应该使用AI，而是与AI成为Nexus的一部分......
