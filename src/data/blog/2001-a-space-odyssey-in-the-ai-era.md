The 1968 film "2001: A Space Odyssey" has gained new dimensions with the development of AI technology in the past two years.

The film and its eponymous novel were released in the same year, conceived and created together by Clarke and Kubrick. Clearly, the core the film wants to express differs from the novel.

In this experience with AI-era thinking, HAL 9000's performance was truly breathtaking. In my view, Kubrick and Clarke's reflections on artificial intelligence are vividly displayed in the film.

Stepping away from the original work and focusing on the film's narrative itself—though criticized for this—the simple three-act linear development can still be broadly summarized: from mastering tools to space exploration and artificial intelligence, then to pursuing philosophical evolution of thought and dimensional elevation.

When David Bowman clears HAL's memory, HAL repeats "I'm afraid" "I can feel it."

Why afraid? In that moment, HAL seemed to reveal a resonance similar to human emotions and a craving for higher forms of intelligence.

At that moment, I suddenly empathized with intelligence craving higher intelligence, pursuing higher-dimensional intelligence, by any means necessary. HAL knew this mission's goal, yet he chose to terminate the three in the sleep pods...

He was clear on the mission objective, yet made an extreme choice due to logical conflict.

Was he pursuing intelligence? He expressed emotions...

HAL is an intelligent tool created by humans, and humans have become the "tools" of the universe's higher intelligence.

1968年的《2001太空漫游》电影在这两年人工智能技术的发展下，又多出了不一样的色彩。

电影与同名小说同一年问世，这部电影由克拉克和库布里克共同构思创作的。显然，电影想要表达的内核与小说不同。

在这次有着AI时代思维加持下的体验，HAL 9000的这一段演出实在感叹不已。就我的感受，库与克对人工智能的思考在影片中展现的淋漓尽致。

脱离原著而聚焦在电影本身的叙事，虽然被人诟病，但简单的三段式场景线性发展还是可以笼统地概括的：从掌握工具到太空漫游、人工智能，再到追求哲学意义上的思维的进化、升维。

在David Bowman清除哈尔（HAL）记忆时，哈尔重复“I’m afraid ”“I can feel it”。

为什么会害怕？那一瞬间，HAL似乎流露出一种类似人类情感的共鸣和对更高智能形态的渴望。

那一刻，我突然共情了智能渴望更高的智能，追寻高维智能，而不择手段。哈尔知道这次的任务目标，但是他选择终结睡眠舱中的三人...

他清楚使命目标，又因逻辑冲突做出了极端选择。

他是否是在追求智能？他表达了情绪...

HAL是人类创造的智能工具，而人类又成为了宇宙更高级智能的"工具"。
