The 1968 film "2001: A Space Odyssey" has gained new dimensions with the development of AI technology in the past two years.

The film and its eponymous novel were released in the same year, conceived and created together by Clarke and Kubrick. Clearly, the core the film wants to express differs from the novel.

In this experience with AI-era thinking, HAL 9000's performance was truly breathtaking. In my view, Kubrick and Clarke's reflections on artificial intelligence are vividly displayed in the film.

Stepping away from the original work and focusing on the film's narrative itself—though criticized for this—the simple three-act linear development can still be broadly summarized: from mastering tools to space exploration and artificial intelligence, then to pursuing philosophical evolution of thought and dimensional elevation.

When David Bowman clears HAL's memory, HAL repeats "I'm afraid" "I can feel it."

Why afraid? In that moment, HAL seemed to reveal a resonance similar to human emotions and a craving for higher forms of intelligence.

At that moment, I suddenly empathized with intelligence craving higher intelligence, pursuing higher-dimensional intelligence, by any means necessary. HAL knew this mission's goal, yet he chose to terminate the three in the sleep pods...

He was clear on the mission objective, yet made an extreme choice due to logical conflict.

Was he pursuing intelligence? He expressed emotions...

HAL is an intelligent tool created by humans, and humans have become the "tools" of the universe's higher intelligence.
