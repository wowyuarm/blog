_Machine learning, especially deep learning, represents a new paradigm of programming and problem-solving._

Traditional programming is logic-driven, encoding knowledge **explicitly** as rules and algorithms; machine learning is data-driven, with models learning **implicit** knowledge and patterns from data.

If we take **technology solving problems** as the primary route:

The core goal of programming in the internet era: building connections, transmitting information, optimizing processes, and providing services. Programming revolves around clear logic and goals, with relatively clear objectives and easily measurable outcomes.

Under this route, the core driving force of AI is to solve more complex, fuzzier problems that traditional programming struggles to address. Beyond this route, AI's initial development also had other objectives such as creating thinking machines and exploring the essence of learning. Today, the **AGI narrative** is also becoming a clear route.

However, the AGI narrative at a macro level can overshadow the actual results of problem-solving. We may overlook, undervalue, or overestimate this new paradigm—the new AI-centric paradigm that changes how knowledge is acquired, expressed, and applied, giving rise to "**Nexus**" ([From Company to Nexus: A New Paradigm for Human-AI Collaboration](/posts/from-company-to-nexus)), which represents the possibility of deep integration between AI and humans.

I firmly believe:

We urgently need a more **sober and balanced** perspective. We must maintain enthusiasm for exploration and forward-thinking regarding long-term goals like AGI, while also fully recognizing and highly valuing current AI technologies represented by deep learning as a **brand new, data-driven, problem-solving** paradigm with its own independent value and revolutionary significance.

This new paradigm is enhancing our ability to understand and transform the world in unprecedented ways. It is not merely some intermediate stage towards AGI (though its research outcomes may contribute to AGI)—it itself is defining a new era—**an "AI-first" era of intelligent augmentation**. The future collaborative form of "Nexus" that I define is precisely the inevitable product of the continuous deepening of this paradigm.
